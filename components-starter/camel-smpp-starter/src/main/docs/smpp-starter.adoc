:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for smpp

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using smpp with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-smpp-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 39 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.smpp.address-range* | You can specify the address range for the SmppConsumer as defined in section 5.2.7 of the SMPP 3.4 specification. The SmppConsumer will receive messages only from SMSC's which target an address (MSISDN or IP address) within this range. |  | String

| *camel.component.smpp.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.smpp.configuration* | To use the shared SmppConfiguration as configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.smpp.SmppConfiguration type. |  | String

| *camel.component.smpp.enquire-link-timer* | Defines the interval in milliseconds between the confidence checks. The confidence check is used to test the communication path between an ESME and an SMSC. | 5000 | Integer
| *camel.component.smpp.http-proxy-host* | If you need to tunnel SMPP through a HTTP proxy, set this attribute to the hostname or ip address of your HTTP proxy. |  | String
| *camel.component.smpp.http-proxy-password* | If your HTTP proxy requires basic authentication, set this attribute to the password required for your HTTP proxy. |  | String
| *camel.component.smpp.http-proxy-port* | If you need to tunnel SMPP through a HTTP proxy, set this attribute to the port of your HTTP proxy. | 3128 | Integer

| *camel.component.smpp.initial-reconnect-delay* | Defines the initial delay in milliseconds after the consumer/producer tries to reconnect to the SMSC, after the connection was lost. | 5000 | Long
| *camel.component.smpp.lazy-session-creation* | Sessions can be lazily created to avoid exceptions, if the SMSC is not available when the Camel producer is started. Camel will check the in message headers 'CamelSmppSystemId' and 'CamelSmppPassword' of the first exchange. If they are present, Camel will use these data to connect to the SMSC. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.smpp.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.smpp.splitting-policy* | You can specify a policy for handling long messages: ALLOW - the default, long messages are split to 140 bytes per message TRUNCATE - long messages are split and only the first fragment will be sent to the SMSC. Some carriers drop subsequent fragments so this reduces load on the SMPP connection sending parts of a message that will never be delivered. REJECT - if a message would need to be split, it is rejected with an SMPP NegativeResponseException and the reason code signifying the message is too long. |  | SmppSplittingPolicy
