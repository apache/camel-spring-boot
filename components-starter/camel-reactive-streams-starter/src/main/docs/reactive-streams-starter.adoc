:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for reactive-streams

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using reactive-streams with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-reactive-streams-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 10 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.backpressure-strategy* | The backpressure strategy to use when pushing events to a slow subscriber. |  | ReactiveStreamsBackpressureStrategy
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the reactive-streams component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.reactive-streams-engine-configuration* | To use an existing reactive stream engine configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.reactive.streams.engine.ReactiveStreamsEngineConfiguration type. |  | ReactiveStreamsEngineConfiguration
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.service-type* | Set the type of the underlying reactive streams implementation to use. The implementation is looked up from the registry or using a ServiceLoader, the default implementation is DefaultCamelReactiveStreamsService |  | String
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.thread-pool-max-size* | The maximum number of threads used by the reactive streams internal engine. | 10 | Integer
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.thread-pool-min-size* | The minimum number of threads used by the reactive streams internal engine. |  | Integer
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.thread-pool-name* | The name of the thread pool used by the reactive streams internal engine. | CamelReactiveStreamsWorker | String
| *camel.component.reactive-streams.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
