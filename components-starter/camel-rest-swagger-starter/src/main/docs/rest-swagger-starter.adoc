:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for rest-swagger

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using rest-swagger with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rest-swagger-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.base-path* | API basePath, for example /v2. Default is unset, if set overrides the value present in Swagger specification. |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.component-name* | Name of the Camel component that will perform the requests. The component must be present in Camel registry and it must implement RestProducerFactory service provider interface. If not set CLASSPATH is searched for single component that implements RestProducerFactory SPI. Can be overridden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.consumes* | What payload type this component capable of consuming. Could be one type, like application/json or multiple types as application/json, application/xml; q=0.5 according to the RFC7231. This equates to the value of Accept HTTP header. If set overrides any value found in the Swagger specification. Can be overridden in endpoint configuration |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the rest-swagger component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.host* | Scheme hostname and port to direct the HTTP requests to in the form of \https://hostname:port. Can be configured at the endpoint, component or in the corresponding REST configuration in the Camel Context. If you give this component a name (e.g. petstore) that REST configuration is consulted first, rest-swagger next, and global configuration last. If set overrides any value found in the Swagger specification, RestConfiguration. Can be overridden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.produces* | What payload type this component is producing. For example application/json according to the RFC7231. This equates to the value of Content-Type HTTP header. If set overrides any value present in the Swagger specification. Can be overridden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.specification-uri* | Path to the Swagger specification file. The scheme, host base path are taken from this specification, but these can be overridden with properties on the component or endpoint level. If not given the component tries to load swagger.json resource. Note that the host defined on the component and endpoint of this Component should contain the scheme, hostname and optionally the port in the URI syntax (i.e. \https://api.example.com:8080). Can be overridden in endpoint configuration. |  | URI
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.ssl-context-parameters* | Customize TLS parameters used by the component. If not set defaults to the TLS parameters set in the Camel context. The option is a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters type. |  | String
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rest-swagger.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
