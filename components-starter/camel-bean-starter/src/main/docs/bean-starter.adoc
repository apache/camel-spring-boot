:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for bean

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using bean with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-bean-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 13 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.bean.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the bean component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.bean.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.bean.scope* | Scope of bean. When using singleton scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint. The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time. When using request scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean while processing a request and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request. The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request. When using delegate scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call. However in case of lookup then this is delegated to the bean registry such as Spring or CDI (if in use), which depends on their configuration can act as either singleton or prototype scope. so when using prototype then this depends on the delegated registry. |  | BeanScope
| *camel.component.class.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the class component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean

| *camel.language.bean.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the bean language. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean

| *camel.language.bean.trim* | Whether to trim the value to remove leading and trailing whitespaces and line breaks | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.bean.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.bean.cache* | *Deprecated* Use singleton option instead. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.class.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.class.cache* | *Deprecated* Use singleton option instead. | true | Boolean
