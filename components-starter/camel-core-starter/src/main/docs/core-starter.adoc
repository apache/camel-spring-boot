| *camel.hystrix.circuit-breaker-force-closed* | If true the HystrixCircuitBreaker#allowRequest() will always return true to allow requests regardless of the error percentage from HystrixCommandMetrics.getHealthCounts(). The circuitBreakerForceOpen() property takes precedence so if it set to true this property does nothing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.hystrix.circuit-breaker-force-open* | If true the HystrixCircuitBreaker.allowRequest() will always return false, causing the circuit to be open (tripped) and reject all requests. This property takes precedence over circuitBreakerForceClosed(); | false | Boolean
| *camel.hystrix.circuit-breaker-request-volume-threshold* | Minimum number of requests in the metricsRollingStatisticalWindowInMilliseconds() that must exist before the HystrixCircuitBreaker will trip. If below this number the circuit will not trip regardless of error percentage. | 20 | Integer

For that, use queueSizeRejectionThreshold(). | -1 | Integer
| *camel.hystrix.maximum-size* | Maximum thread-pool size that gets passed to ThreadPoolExecutor#setMaximumPoolSize(int) . This is the maximum amount of concurrency that can be supported without starting to reject HystrixCommands. Please note that this setting only takes effect if you also set allowMaximumSizeToDivergeFromCoreSize | 10 | Integer
| *camel.hystrix.metrics-health-snapshot-interval-in-milliseconds* | Time in milliseconds to wait between allowing health snapshots to be taken that calculate success and error percentages and affect HystrixCircuitBreaker.isOpen() status. On high-volume circuits the continual calculation of error percentage can become CPU intensive thus this controls how often it is calculated. | 500 | Integer

| *camel.hystrix.queue-size-rejection-threshold* | Queue size rejection threshold is an artificial max size at which rejections will occur even if maxQueueSize has not been reached. This is done because the maxQueueSize of a BlockingQueue can not be dynamically changed and we want to support dynamically changing the queue size that affects rejections. This is used by HystrixCommand when queuing a thread for execution. | 5 | Integer
| *camel.hystrix.request-log-enabled* | Whether HystrixCommand execution and events should be logged to HystrixRequestLog. | true | Boolean
| *camel.hystrix.thread-pool-key* | Sets the thread pool key to use. Will by default use the same value as groupKey has been configured to use. | CamelHystrix | String

Default value is 50 percentage. |  | Float
| *camel.resilience4j.minimum-number-of-calls* | Configures the minimum number of calls which are required (per sliding window period) before the CircuitBreaker can calculate the error rate. For example, if minimumNumberOfCalls is 10, then at least 10 calls must be recorded, before the failure rate can be calculated. If only 9 calls have been recorded the CircuitBreaker will not transition to open even if all 9 calls have failed. Default minimumNumberOfCalls is 100 | 100 | Integer
| *camel.resilience4j.permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state* | Configures the number of permitted calls when the CircuitBreaker is half open. The size must be greater than 0. Default size is 10. | 10 | Integer

| *camel.resilience4j.slow-call-rate-threshold* | Configures a threshold in percentage. The CircuitBreaker considers a call as slow when the call duration is greater than slowCallDurationThreshold Duration. When the percentage of slow calls is equal or greater the threshold, the CircuitBreaker transitions to open and starts short-circuiting calls. The threshold must be greater than 0 and not greater than 100. Default value is 100 percentage which means that all recorded calls must be slower than slowCallDurationThreshold. |  | Float

| *camel.rest.api-component* | The name of the Camel component to use as the REST API (such as swagger) If no API Component has been explicit configured, then Camel will lookup if there is a Camel component responsible for servicing and generating the REST API documentation, or if a org.apache.camel.spi.RestApiProcessorFactory is registered in the registry. If either one is found, then that is being used. |  | String
| *camel.rest.api-context-id-pattern* | Sets an CamelContext id pattern to only allow Rest APIs from rest services within CamelContext's which name matches the pattern.

| *camel.rest.binding-mode* | Sets the binding mode to use. The default value is off |  | RestBindingMode
| *camel.rest.client-request-validation* | Whether to enable validation of the client request to check whether the Content-Type and Accept headers from the client is supported by the Rest-DSL configuration of its consumes/produces settings. This can be turned on, to enable this check. In case of validation error, then HTTP Status codes 415 or 406 is returned. The default value is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.rest.component* | The Camel Rest component to use for the REST transport (consumer), such as netty-http, jetty, servlet, undertow. If no component has been explicit configured, then Camel will lookup if there is a Camel component that integrates with the Rest DSL, or if a org.apache.camel.spi.RestConsumerFactory is registered in the registry. If either one is found, then that is being used. |  | String
| *camel.rest.component-property* | Allows to configure as many additional properties for the rest component in use. |  | Map
| *camel.rest.consumer-property* | Allows to configure as many additional properties for the rest consumer in use. |  | Map
| *camel.rest.context-path* | Sets a leading context-path the REST services will be using.

Or for components such as camel-jetty or camel-netty-http that includes a HTTP server. |  | String
| *camel.rest.cors-headers* | Allows to configure custom CORS headers. |  | Map
| *camel.rest.data-format-property* | Allows to configure as many additional properties for the data formats in use. For example set property prettyPrint to true to have json outputted in pretty mode. The properties can be prefixed to denote the option is only for either JSON or XML and for either the IN or the OUT. The prefixes are: json.in. json.out. xml.in. xml.out. For example a key with value xml.out.mustBeJAXBElement is only for the XML data format for the outgoing. A key without a prefix is a common key for all situations. |  | Map
| *camel.rest.enable-cors* | Whether to enable CORS headers in the HTTP response. The default value is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.rest.endpoint-property* | Allows to configure as many additional properties for the rest endpoint in use. |  | Map
| *camel.rest.host* | The hostname to use for exposing the REST service. |  | String
| *camel.rest.host-name-resolver* | If no hostname has been explicit configured, then this resolver is used to compute the hostname the REST service will be using. |  | RestHostNameResolver
| *camel.rest.json-data-format* | Name of specific json data format to use. By default json-jackson will be used. Important: This option is only for setting a custom name of the data format, not to refer to an existing data format instance. |  | String
| *camel.rest.port* | The port number to use for exposing the REST service. Notice if you use servlet component then the port number configured here does not apply, as the port number in use is the actual port number the servlet component is using. eg if using Apache Tomcat its the tomcat http port, if using Apache Karaf its the HTTP service in Karaf that uses port 8181 by default etc. Though in those situations setting the port number here, allows tooling and JMX to know the port number, so its recommended to set the port number to the number that the servlet engine uses. |  | String
| *camel.rest.producer-api-doc* | Sets the location of the api document (swagger api) the REST producer will use to validate the REST uri and query parameters are valid accordingly to the api document. This requires adding camel-swagger-java to the classpath, and any miss configuration will let Camel fail on startup and report the error(s). The location of the api document is loaded from classpath by default, but you can use file: or http: to refer to resources to load from file or http url. |  | String
| *camel.rest.producer-component* | Sets the name of the Camel component to use as the REST producer |  | String
| *camel.rest.scheme* | The scheme to use for exposing the REST service. Usually http or https is supported. The default value is http |  | String
| *camel.rest.skip-binding-on-error-code* | Whether to skip binding on output if there is a custom HTTP error code header. This allows to build custom error messages that do not bind to json / xml etc, as success messages otherwise will do. | false | Boolean
| *camel.rest.use-x-forward-headers* | Whether to use X-Forward headers for Host and related setting. The default value is true. | true | Boolean
| *camel.rest.xml-data-format* | Name of specific XML data format to use. By default jaxb will be used. Important: This option is only for setting a custom name of the data format, not to refer to an existing data format instance. |  | String
