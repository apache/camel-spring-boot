:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for debezium-sqlserver

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using debezium-sqlserver with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-debezium-sqlserver-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 70 options, which are listed below.

The default is 'repeatable_read', which means that repeatable read isolation level is used. In addition, exclusive locks are taken only during schema snapshot. Using a value of 'exclusive' ensures that the connector holds the exclusive lock (and thus prevents any reads and updates) for all monitored tables during the entire snapshot duration. When 'snapshot' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in SNAPSHOT isolation level, which guarantees snapshot consistency. In addition, neither table nor row-level locks are held. When 'read_committed' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in READ COMMITTED isolation level. No long-running locks are taken, so that initial snapshot does not prevent other transactions from updating table rows.

Options include: 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector should run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'schema_only' to specify the connector should run a snapshot of the schema when no offsets are available for the logical server name. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String

| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.table-whitelist* | The tables for which changes are to be captured (deprecated, use table.include.list instead) |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.time-precision-mode* | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
