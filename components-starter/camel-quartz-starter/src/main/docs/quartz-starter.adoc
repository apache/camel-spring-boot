  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

| *camel.component.quartz.auto-start-scheduler* | Whether or not the scheduler should be auto started. This options is default true | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| *camel.component.quartz.prefix-instance-name* | Whether to prefix the Quartz Scheduler instance name with the CamelContext name. This is enabled by default, to let each CamelContext use its own Quartz scheduler instance by default.
