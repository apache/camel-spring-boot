:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for quartz

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using quartz with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-quartz-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 14 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.quartz.auto-start-scheduler* | Whether or not the scheduler should be auto started. This options is default true | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.autowired-enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.enable-jmx* | Whether to enable Quartz JMX which allows to manage the Quartz scheduler from JMX. This options is default true | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the quartz component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.interrupt-jobs-on-shutdown* | Whether to interrupt jobs on shutdown which forces the scheduler to shutdown quicker and attempt to interrupt any running jobs. If this is enabled then any running jobs can fail due to being interrupted. When a job is interrupted then Camel will mark the exchange to stop continue routing and set java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException as caused exception. Therefore use this with care, as its often better to allow Camel jobs to complete and shutdown gracefully. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.prefix-instance-name* | Whether to prefix the Quartz Scheduler instance name with the CamelContext name. This is enabled by default, to let each CamelContext use its own Quartz scheduler instance by default. You can set this option to false to reuse Quartz scheduler instances between multiple CamelContext's. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.prefix-job-name-with-endpoint-id* | Whether to prefix the quartz job with the endpoint id. This option is default false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.quartz.properties* | Properties to configure the Quartz scheduler. |  | Map
| *camel.component.quartz.properties-file* | File name of the properties to load from the classpath |  | String
| *camel.component.quartz.properties-ref* | References to an existing Properties or Map to lookup in the registry to use for configuring quartz. |  | String
| *camel.component.quartz.scheduler* | To use the custom configured Quartz scheduler, instead of creating a new Scheduler. The option is a org.quartz.Scheduler type. |  | Scheduler
| *camel.component.quartz.scheduler-factory* | To use the custom SchedulerFactory which is used to create the Scheduler. The option is a org.quartz.SchedulerFactory type. |  | SchedulerFactory
| *camel.component.quartz.start-delayed-seconds* | Seconds to wait before starting the quartz scheduler. |  | Integer
