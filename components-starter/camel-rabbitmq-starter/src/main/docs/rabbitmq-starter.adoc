:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for rabbitmq

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using rabbitmq with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 57 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.additional-headers* | Map of additional headers. These headers will be set only when the 'allowCustomHeaders' is set to true |  | Map
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.additional-properties* | Map of additional properties. These are standard RabbitMQ properties as defined in com.rabbitmq.client.AMQP.BasicProperties The map keys should be from org.apache.camel.component.rabbitmq.RabbitMQConstants. Any other keys will be ignored. When the message already contains these headers they will be given precedence over these properties. |  | Map
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.addresses* | If this option is set, camel-rabbitmq will try to create connection based on the setting of option addresses. The addresses value is a string which looks like server1:12345, server2:12345 |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.allow-null-headers* | Allow pass null values to header | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.args* | Specify arguments for configuring the different RabbitMQ concepts, a different prefix is required for each: Exchange: arg.exchange. Queue: arg.queue. Binding: arg.binding. DLQ: arg.dlq.queue. DLQ Binding: arg.dlq.binding. For example to declare a queue with message ttl argument: \http://localhost:5672/exchange/queueargs=arg.queue.x-message-ttl=60000 |  | Map
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.auto-ack* | If messages should be auto acknowledged | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.auto-delete* | If it is true, the exchange will be deleted when it is no longer in use | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.auto-detect-connection-factory* | Whether to auto-detect looking up RabbitMQ connection factory from the registry. When enabled and a single instance of the connection factory is found then it will be used. An explicit connection factory can be configured on the component or endpoint level which takes precedence. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.automatic-recovery-enabled* | Enables connection automatic recovery (uses connection implementation that performs automatic recovery when connection shutdown is not initiated by the application) |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.autowired-enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.channel-pool-max-size* | Get maximum number of opened channel in pool | 10 | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.channel-pool-max-wait* | Set the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a channel from the pool | 1000 | Long
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.client-properties* | Connection client properties (client info used in negotiating with the server) |  | Map
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.connection-factory* | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set, all connection options (connectionTimeout, requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used. The option is a com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory type. |  | ConnectionFactory
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.connection-factory-exception-handler* | Custom rabbitmq ExceptionHandler for ConnectionFactory. The option is a com.rabbitmq.client.ExceptionHandler type. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.connection-timeout* | Connection timeout | 60000 | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.dead-letter-exchange* | The name of the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.dead-letter-exchange-type* | The type of the dead letter exchange | direct | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.dead-letter-queue* | The name of the dead letter queue |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.dead-letter-routing-key* | The routing key for the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.declare* | If the option is true, camel declare the exchange and queue name and bind them together. If the option is false, camel won't declare the exchange and queue name on the server. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.durable* | If we are declaring a durable exchange (the exchange will survive a server restart) | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the rabbitmq component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.exclusive* | Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection, and are deleted when that connection closes. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.exclusive-consumer* | Request exclusive access to the queue (meaning only this consumer can access the queue). This is useful when you want a long-lived shared queue to be temporarily accessible by just one consumer. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.guaranteed-deliveries* | When true, an exception will be thrown when the message cannot be delivered (basic.return) and the message is marked as mandatory. PublisherAcknowledgement will also be activated in this case. See also publisher acknowledgements - When will messages be confirmed. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.hostname* | The hostname of the running RabbitMQ instance or cluster. |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.immediate* | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue consumer immediately. If this flag is set, the server will return an undeliverable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero, the server will queue the message, but with no guarantee that it will ever be consumed. If the header is present rabbitmq.IMMEDIATE it will override this option. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.mandatory* | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue. If this flag is set, the server will return an unroutable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero, the server silently drops the message. If the header is present rabbitmq.MANDATORY it will override this option. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.network-recovery-interval* | Network recovery interval in milliseconds (interval used when recovering from network failure) | 5000 | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.passive* | Passive queues depend on the queue already to be available at RabbitMQ. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.password* | Password for authenticated access | guest | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.port-number* | Port number for the host with the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. | 5672 | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.prefetch-count* | The maximum number of messages that the server will deliver, 0 if unlimited. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize, prefetchCount, prefetchGlobal at the same time |  | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.prefetch-enabled* | Enables the quality of service on the RabbitMQConsumer side. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize, prefetchCount, prefetchGlobal at the same time | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.prefetch-global* | If the settings should be applied to the entire channel rather than each consumer You need to specify the option of prefetchSize, prefetchCount, prefetchGlobal at the same time | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.prefetch-size* | The maximum amount of content (measured in octets) that the server will deliver, 0 if unlimited. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize, prefetchCount, prefetchGlobal at the same time |  | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.publisher-acknowledgements* | When true, the message will be published with publisher acknowledgements turned on | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.publisher-acknowledgements-timeout* | The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a basic.ack response from RabbitMQ server |  | Long
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.recover-from-declare-exception* | Decides whether an exception during declaration of exchanges or queues is recoverable or not. If the option is false, camel will throw an exception when starting the consumer, which will interrupt application startup (e.g. in the case when the exchange / queue is already declared in RabbitMQ and has incompatible configuration). If set to true, the consumer will try to reconnect periodically. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.request-timeout* | Set timeout for waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern (in milliseconds) | 20000 | Long
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.request-timeout-checker-interval* | Set requestTimeoutCheckerInterval for inOut exchange | 1000 | Long

| *camel.component.rabbitmq.requested-heartbeat* | Connection requested heartbeat (heart-beat in seconds offered) | 60 | Integer
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.skip-exchange-declare* | This can be used if we need to declare the queue but not the exchange | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.skip-queue-bind* | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.skip-queue-declare* | If true the producer will not declare and bind a queue. This can be used for directing messages via an existing routing key. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.ssl-protocol* | Enables SSL on connection, accepted value are true, TLS and 'SSLv3 |  | String
| *camel.component.rabbitmq.thread-pool-size* | The consumer uses a Thread Pool Executor with a fixed number of threads. This setting allows you to set that number of threads. | 10 | Integer
