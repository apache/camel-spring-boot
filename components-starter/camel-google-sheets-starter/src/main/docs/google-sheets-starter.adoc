:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for google-sheets

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using google-sheets with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-google-sheets-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 30 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.access-token* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.application-name* | Google sheets application name. Example would be camel-google-sheets/1.0 |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.client-factory* | To use the GoogleSheetsClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.google.sheets.GoogleSheetsClientFactory type. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.client-id* | Client ID of the sheets application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.client-secret* | Client secret of the sheets application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.configuration* | To use the shared configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.google.sheets.stream.GoogleSheetsStreamConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the google-sheets-stream component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.include-grid-data* | True if grid data should be returned. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.major-dimension* | Specifies the major dimension that results should use.. | ROWS | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.max-results* | Specify the maximum number of returned results. This will limit the number of rows in a returned value range data set or the number of returned value ranges in a batch request. |  | Integer
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.range* | Specifies the range of rows and columns in a sheet to get data from. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.refresh-token* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.scopes* | Specifies the level of permissions you want a sheets application to have to a user account. See \https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes for more info. |  | List
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.split-results* | True if value range result should be split into rows or columns to process each of them individually. When true each row or column is represented with a separate exchange in batch processing. Otherwise value range object is used as exchange junk size. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.spreadsheet-id* | Specifies the spreadsheet identifier that is used to identify the target to obtain. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.value-render-option* | Determines how values should be rendered in the output. | FORMATTED_VALUE | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.access-token* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.application-name* | Google Sheets application name. Example would be camel-google-sheets/1.0 |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets.client-factory* | To use the GoogleSheetsClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleSheetsClientFactory. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.google.sheets.GoogleSheetsClientFactory type. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.client-id* | Client ID of the sheets application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.client-secret* | Client secret of the sheets application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.configuration* | To use the shared configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.google.sheets.GoogleSheetsConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the google-sheets component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets.refresh-token* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Sheets component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-sheets.split-result* | When consumer return an array or collection this will generate one exchange per element, and their routes will be executed once for each exchange.Set this value to false to use a single exchange for the entire list or array. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets-stream.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-sheets.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
