|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.dataformat.json-xstream.content-type-header* | Whether the data format should set the Content-Type header with the type from the data format if the data format is capable of doing so. For example application/xml for data formats marshalling to XML, or application/json for data formats marshalling to JSon etc. | false | Boolean
| *camel.dataformat.json-xstream.drop-root-node* | Whether XStream will drop the root node in the generated JSon. You may want to enable this when using POJOs; as then the written object will include the class name as root node, which is often not intended to be written in the JSon output. | false | Boolean

Wildcards is supported by using . as prefix. For example to allow com.foo and all subpackages then specify com.foo.. Multiple permissions can be configured separated by comma, such as com.foo.,-com.foo.bar.MySecretBean. The following default permission is always included: -,java.lang.,java.util. unless its overridden by specifying a JVM system property with they key org.apache.camel.xstream.permissions. |  | String
