:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for salesforce

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using salesforce with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-salesforce-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 80 options, which are listed below.

Salesforce component can auto-determine the authentication method to use from the properties set, set this property to eliminate any ambiguity. |  | AuthenticationType
| *camel.component.salesforce.autowired-enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.

Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

Multiple packages can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.component.salesforce.password* | Password used in OAuth flow to gain access to access token. It's easy to get started with password OAuth flow, but in general one should avoid it as it is deemed less secure than other flows. Make sure that you append security token to the end of the password if using one. |  | String
| *camel.component.salesforce.pk-chunking* | Use PK Chunking. Only for use in original Bulk API. Bulk 2.0 API performs PK chunking automatically, if necessary. |  | Boolean

| *camel.component.salesforce.refresh-token* | Refresh token already obtained in the refresh token OAuth flow. One needs to setup a web application and configure a callback URL to receive the refresh token, or configure using the builtin callback at \https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success or \https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success and then retrive the refresh_token from the URL at the end of the flow. Note that in development organizations Salesforce allows hosting the callback web application at localhost. |  | String
