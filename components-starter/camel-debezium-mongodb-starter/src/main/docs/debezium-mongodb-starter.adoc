:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for debezium-mongodb

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using debezium-mongodb with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-debezium-mongodb-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 59 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-mongodb.additional-properties* | Additional properties for debezium components in case they can't be set directly on the camel configurations (e.g: setting Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine, for example setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore), the properties have to be prefixed with additionalProperties..
