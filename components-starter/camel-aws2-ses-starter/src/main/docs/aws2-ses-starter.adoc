----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>

  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 16 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.access-key* | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.amazon-s-e-s-client* | To use the AmazonSimpleEmailService as the client. The option is a software.amazon.awssdk.services.ses.SesClient type. |  | String
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.configuration* | component configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.aws2.ses.Ses2Configuration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the aws2-ses component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.proxy-host* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SES client |  | String
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.proxy-port* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the SES client |  | Integer
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.proxy-protocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SES client |  | Protocol
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.region* | The region in which SES client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.reply-to-addresses* | List of reply-to email address(es) for the message, override it using 'CamelAwsSesReplyToAddresses' header. |  | List
| *camel.component.aws2-ses.return-path* | The email address to which bounce notifications are to be forwarded, override it using 'CamelAwsSesReturnPath' header. |  | String
