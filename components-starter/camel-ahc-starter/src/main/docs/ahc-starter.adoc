:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for ahc

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using ahc with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-ahc-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 10 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.ahc.allow-java-serialized-object* | Whether to allow java serialization when a request uses context-type=application/x-java-serialized-object This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ahc.binding* | To use a custom AhcBinding which allows to control how to bind between AHC and Camel. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.ahc.AhcBinding type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ahc.client* | To use a custom AsyncHttpClient. The option is a org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClient type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ahc.client-config* | To configure the AsyncHttpClient to use a custom com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpClientConfig instance. The option is a org.asynchttpclient.AsyncHttpClientConfig type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ahc.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the ahc component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.ahc.header-filter-strategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. The option is a org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ahc.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ahc.ssl-context-parameters* | Reference to a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters in the Registry. Note that configuring this option will override any SSL/TLS configuration options provided through the clientConfig option at the endpoint or component level. The option is a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ahc.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ahc.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
