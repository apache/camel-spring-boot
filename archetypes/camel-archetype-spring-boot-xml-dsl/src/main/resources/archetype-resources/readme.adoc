= Camel Example Spring Boot

This example shows how to work with a simple Apache Camel application using Spring Boot.

The example generates messages using timer trigger, writes them to standard output.

== Camel routes

The Camel route is located in the `MyCamelRouter` class. In this class the route
starts from a timer, that triggers every 2nd second and calls a Spring Bean `MyBean`
which returns a message, that is routed to a stream endpoint which writes to standard output.
The example contains test class demonstrating how to intercept and mock endpoints in unit tests using JUnit 5 and Camel Test Support.

== Using Camel components

Apache Camel provides 300+ components which you can use to integrate and route messages between many systems
and data formats. To use any of these Camel components, add the component as a dependency to your project.
