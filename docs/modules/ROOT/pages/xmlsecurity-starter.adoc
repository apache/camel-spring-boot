The component supports 64 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.add-key-info-reference* | In order to protect the KeyInfo element from tampering you can add a reference to the signed info element so that it is protected via the signature value. The default value is true. Only relevant when a KeyInfo is returned by KeyAccessor. and KeyInfo#getId() is not null. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.base-uri* | You can set a base URI which is used in the URI dereferencing. Relative URIs are then concatenated with the base URI. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.canonicalization-method* | Canonicalization method used to canonicalize the SignedInfo element before the digest is calculated. You can use the helper methods XmlSignatureHelper.getCanonicalizationMethod(String algorithm) or getCanonicalizationMethod(String algorithm, List inclusiveNamespacePrefixes) to create a canonicalization method. The option is a javax.xml.crypto.AlgorithmMethod type. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.clear-headers* | Determines if the XML signature specific headers be cleared after signing and verification. Defaults to true. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.content-object-id* | Sets the content object Id attribute value. By default a UUID is generated. If you set the null value, then a new UUID will be generated. Only used in the enveloping case. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.content-reference-type* | Type of the content reference. The default value is null. This value can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_CONTENT_REFERENCE_TYPE. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.content-reference-uri* | Reference URI for the content to be signed. Only used in the enveloped case. If the reference URI contains an ID attribute value, then the resource schema URI ( setSchemaResourceUri(String)) must also be set because the schema validator will then find out which attributes are ID attributes. Will be ignored in the enveloping or detached case. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.crypto-context-properties* | Sets the crypto context properties. See {link XMLCryptoContext#setProperty(String, Object)}. Possible properties are defined in XMLSignContext an XMLValidateContext (see Supported Properties). The following properties are set by default to the value Boolean#TRUE for the XML validation. If you want to switch these features off you must set the property value to Boolean#FALSE. org.jcp.xml.dsig.validateManifests javax.xml.crypto.dsig.cacheReference |  | Map
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.digest-algorithm* | Digest algorithm URI. Optional parameter. This digest algorithm is used for calculating the digest of the input message.

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.omit-xml-declaration* | Indicator whether the XML declaration in the outgoing message body should be omitted. Default value is false. Can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_OMIT_XML_DECLARATION. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.parent-xpath* | Sets the XPath to find the parent node in the enveloped case. Either you specify the parent node via this method or the local name and namespace of the parent with the methods setParentLocalName(String) and setParentNamespace(String). Default value is null. The value must be null for enveloping and detached XML signature. If the parameters parentXpath and parentLocalName are specified in the same configuration then an exception is thrown. The option is a javax.xml.crypto.dsig.spec.XPathFilterParameterSpec type. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.plain-text* | Indicator whether the message body contains plain text. The default value is false, indicating that the message body contains XML. The value can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_MESSAGE_IS_PLAIN_TEXT. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-sign.xpaths-to-id-attributes* | Define the elements which are signed in the detached case via XPATH expressions to ID attributes (attributes of type ID). For each element found via the XPATH expression a detached signature is created whose reference URI contains the corresponding attribute value (preceded by '#'). The signature becomes the last sibling of the signed element. Elements with deeper hierarchy level are signed first. You can also set the XPATH list dynamically via the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_XPATHS_TO_ID_ATTRIBUTES.

Normally, this is only necessary, if the XML signature is enveloped. The default value is Boolean#FALSE. This parameter is forwarded to XmlSignature2Message. This indicator has no effect if the output node search is of type DefaultXmlSignature2Message#OUTPUT_NODE_SEARCH_TYPE_DEFAULT.F | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-verify.schema-resource-uri* | Classpath to the XML Schema. Must be specified in the detached XML Signature case for determining the ID attributes, might be set in the enveloped and enveloping case.

| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-verify.secure-validation* | Enables secure validation. If true then secure validation is enabled. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-verify.uri-dereferencer* | If you want to restrict the remote access via reference URIs, you can set an own dereferencer. Optional parameter.

This step is recommended in \http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-bestpractices/#check-what-is-signed. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api.XmlSignatureChecker type. |  | String
| *camel.component.xmlsecurity-verify.xml-signature2-message* | Bean which maps the XML signature to the output-message after the validation. How this mapping should be done can be configured by the options outputNodeSearchType, outputNodeSearch, and removeSignatureElements. The default implementation offers three possibilities which are related to the three output node search types Default, ElementName, and XPath. The default implementation determines a node which is then serialized and set to the body of the output message If the search type is ElementName then the output node (which must be in this case an element) is determined by the local name and namespace defined in the search value (see option outputNodeSearch). If the search type is XPath then the output node is determined by the XPath specified in the search value (in this case the output node can be of type Element, TextNode or Document). If the output node search type is Default then the following rules apply: In the enveloped XML signature case (there is a reference with URI= and transform \http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature), the incoming XML document without the Signature element is set to the output message body. In the non-enveloped XML signature case, the message body is determined from a referenced Object; this is explained in more detail in chapter Output Node Determination in Enveloping XML Signature Case.
