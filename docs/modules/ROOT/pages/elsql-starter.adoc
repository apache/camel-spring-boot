== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using elsql with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-elsql-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 8 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.elsql.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elsql.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elsql.data-source* | Sets the DataSource to use to communicate with the database. The option is a javax.sql.DataSource type. |  | String
| *camel.component.elsql.database-vendor* | To use a vendor specific com.opengamma.elsql.ElSqlConfig |  | ElSqlDatabaseVendor
| *camel.component.elsql.el-sql-config* | To use a specific configured ElSqlConfig. It may be better to use the databaseVendor option instead. The option is a com.opengamma.elsql.ElSqlConfig type. |  | String
| *camel.component.elsql.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the elsql component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.elsql.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elsql.resource-uri* | The resource file which contains the elsql SQL statements to use. You can specify multiple resources separated by comma. The resources are loaded on the classpath by default, you can prefix with file: to load from file system. Notice you can set this option on the component and then you do not have to configure this on the endpoint. |  | String
