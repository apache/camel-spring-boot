When using file-watch with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-file-watch-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 8 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.file-watch.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.file-watch.concurrent-consumers* | The number of concurrent consumers. Increase this value, if your route is slow to prevent buffering in queue. | 1 | Integer
| *camel.component.file-watch.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the file-watch component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.file-watch.file-hasher* | Reference to io.methvin.watcher.hashing.FileHasher. This prevents emitting duplicate events on some platforms. For working with large files and if you dont need detect multiple modifications per second per file, use #lastModifiedTimeFileHasher. You can also provide custom implementation in registry. The option is a io.methvin.watcher.hashing.FileHasher type. |  | String
| *camel.component.file-watch.poll-threads* | The number of threads polling WatchService. Increase this value, if you see OVERFLOW messages in log. | 1 | Integer
| *camel.component.file-watch.queue-size* | Maximum size of queue between WatchService and consumer. Unbounded by default. | 2147483647 | Integer
| *camel.component.file-watch.use-file-hashing* | Enables or disables file hashing to detect duplicate events. If you disable this, you can get some events multiple times on some platforms and JDKs. Check java.nio.file.WatchService limitations for your target platform. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.file-watch.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
