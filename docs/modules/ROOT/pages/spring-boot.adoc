= Spring Boot

*Since Camel 2.15*

Spring Boot component provides auto-configuration for Apache Camel. Our
opinionated auto-configuration of the Camel context auto-detects Camel
routes available in the Spring context and registers the key Camel
utilities (like producer template, consumer template and the type
converter) as beans.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
in order to use this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-boot</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

`camel-spring-boot` jar comes with the `spring.factories` file, so as
soon as you add that dependency into your classpath, Spring Boot will
automatically auto-configure Camel for you.

[[SpringBoot-CamelSpringBootStarter]]
== Camel Spring Boot Starter

*Since Camel 2.17*

Apache Camel ships
a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters[Spring
Boot Starter] module that allows you to develop Spring Boot applications
using starters. There is a
https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/tree/master/camel-example-spring-boot[sample
application] in the source code also.

To use the starter, add the following to your spring boot pom.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

Then you can just add classes with your Camel routes such as:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("timer:foo").to("log:bar");
    }
}
----

Then these routes will be started automatically.

You can customize the Camel application in the `application.properties`
or `application.yml` file.

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using spring-boot with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 165 options, which are listed below.

| *camel.springboot.allow-use-original-message* | Sets whether to allow access to the original message from Camel's error handler, or from org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork.getOriginalInMessage(). Turning this off can optimize performance, as defensive copy of the original message is not needed. Default is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.auto-startup* | Sets whether the object should automatically start when Camel starts. Important: Currently only routes can be disabled, as CamelContext's are always started. Note: When setting auto startup false on CamelContext then that takes precedence and no routes is started. You would need to start CamelContext explicit using the org.apache.camel.CamelContext.start() method, to start the context, and then you would need to start the routes manually using Camelcontext.getRouteController().startRoute(String). Default is true to always start up. | true | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.autowired-enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.

Be careful to turn this off, as this means that beans that use Camel annotations such as org.apache.camel.EndpointInject, org.apache.camel.ProducerTemplate, org.apache.camel.Produce, org.apache.camel.Consume etc will not be injected and in use. Turning this off should only be done if you are sure you do not use any of these Camel features. Not all runtimes allow turning this off (such as camel-blueprint or camel-cdi with XML). The default value is true (enabled). | true | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.case-insensitive-headers* | Whether to use case sensitive or insensitive headers. Important: When using case sensitive (this is set to false). Then the map is case sensitive which means headers such as content-type and Content-Type are two different keys which can be a problem for some protocols such as HTTP based, which rely on case insensitive headers. However case sensitive implementations can yield faster performance. Therefore use case sensitive implementation with care. Default is true. | true | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.consumer-template-cache-size* | Consumer template endpoints cache size. | 1000 | Integer
| *camel.springboot.duration-max-idle-seconds* | To specify for how long time in seconds Camel can be idle before automatic terminating the JVM. You can use this to run Spring Boot for a short while. | 0 | Integer

| *camel.springboot.endpoint-bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. <p/> By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored. The default value is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.endpoint-lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. The default value is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.endpoint-runtime-statistics-enabled* | Sets whether endpoint runtime statistics is enabled (gathers runtime usage of each incoming and outgoing endpoints). The default value is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.file-configurations* | Directory to load additional configuration files that contains configuration values that takes precedence over any other configuration. This can be used to refer to files that may have secret configuration that has been mounted on the file system for containers. You must use either file: or classpath: as prefix to load from file system or classpath. Then you can specify a pattern to load from sub directories and a name pattern such as file:/var/app/secret/*.properties |  | String
| *camel.springboot.include-non-singletons* | Whether to include non-singleton beans (prototypes) when scanning for RouteBuilder instances. By default only singleton beans is included in the context scan. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.inflight-repository-browse-enabled* | Sets whether the inflight repository should allow browsing each inflight exchange. This is by default disabled as there is a very slight performance overhead when enabled. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.java-routes-exclude-pattern* | Used for exclusive filtering component scanning of RouteBuilder classes with @Component annotation. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma. For example to exclude all classes starting with Bar use: &#42;&#42;/Bar&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package and its sub-packages use double wildcards: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;&#42; And to exclude all routes from two specific packages use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;,com/mycompany/stuff/&#42; |  | String
| *camel.springboot.java-routes-include-pattern* | Used for inclusive filtering component scanning of RouteBuilder classes with @Component annotation. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma. For example to include all classes starting with Foo use: &#42;&#42;/Foo* To include all routes form a specific package use: com/mycompany/foo/&#42; To include all routes form a specific package and its sub-packages use double wildcards: com/mycompany/foo/&#42;&#42; And to include all routes from two specific packages use: com/mycompany/foo/&#42;,com/mycompany/stuff/&#42; |  | String

| *camel.springboot.load-type-converters* | Whether to load custom type converters by scanning classpath. This is used for backwards compatibility with Camel 2.x. Its recommended to migrate to use fast type converter loading by setting <tt>@Converter(generateLoader = true)</tt> on your custom type converter classes. | true | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.log-debug-max-chars* | Is used to limit the maximum length of the logging Camel message bodies. If the message body is longer than the limit, the log message is clipped. Use -1 to have unlimited length. Use for example 1000 to log at most 1000 characters. | 0 | Integer
| *camel.springboot.log-exhausted-message-body* | Sets whether to log exhausted message body with message history. Default is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.log-mask* | Sets whether log mask is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.main-run-controller* | Whether to use the main run controller to ensure the Spring-Boot application keeps running until being stopped or the JVM terminated. You typically only need this if you run Spring-Boot standalone. If you run Spring-Boot with spring-boot-starter-web then the web container keeps the JVM running. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.mdc-logging-keys-pattern* | Sets the pattern used for determining which custom MDC keys to propagate during message routing when the routing engine continues routing asynchronously for the given message. Setting this pattern to * will propagate all custom keys. Or setting the pattern to foo*,bar* will propagate any keys starting with either foo or bar. Notice that a set of standard Camel MDC keys are always propagated which starts with camel. as key name. The match rules are applied in this order (case insensitive): 1. exact match, returns true 2. wildcard match (pattern ends with a * and the name starts with the pattern), returns true 3. regular expression match, returns true 4. otherwise returns false |  | String
| *camel.springboot.message-history* | Sets whether message history is enabled or not. Default is true. | true | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.name* | Sets the name of the CamelContext. |  | String

| *camel.springboot.route-controller-route-startup-logging-level* | Sets the logging level used for logging route startup activity. By default INFO level is used. You can use this to change the level for example to OFF if this kind of logging is not wanted. |  | LoggingLevel
| *camel.springboot.route-controller-supervise-enabled* | To enable using supervising route controller which allows Camel to startup and then the controller takes care of starting the routes in a safe manner. This can be used when you want to startup Camel despite a route may otherwise fail fast during startup and cause Camel to fail to startup as well. By delegating the route startup to the supervising route controller then it manages the startup using a background thread. The controller allows to be configured with various settings to attempt to restart failing routes. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.route-controller-thread-pool-size* | The number of threads used by the route controller scheduled thread pool that are used for restarting routes. The pool uses 1 thread by default, but you can increase this to allow the controller to concurrently attempt to restart multiple routes in case more than one route has problems starting. | 1 | Integer
| *camel.springboot.route-controller-unhealthy-on-exhausted* | Whether to mark the route as unhealthy (down) when all restarting attempts (backoff) have failed and the route is not successfully started and the route manager is giving up. Setting this to true allows health checks to know about this and can report the Camel application as DOWN. The default is false. | false | Boolean
| *camel.springboot.route-filter-exclude-pattern* | Used for filtering routes routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression. For example to only include routes which starts with foo in their route id's, use: include=foo&#42; And to exclude routes which starts from JMS endpoints, use: exclude=jms:&#42; Multiple patterns can be separated by comma, for example to exclude both foo and bar routes, use: exclude=foo&#42;,bar&#42; Exclude takes precedence over include. |  | String
| *camel.springboot.route-filter-include-pattern* | Used for filtering routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression. For example to only include routes which starts with foo in their route id's, use: include=foo&#42; And to exclude routes which starts from JMS endpoints, use: exclude=jms:&#42; Multiple patterns can be separated by comma, for example to exclude both foo and bar routes, use: exclude=foo&#42;,bar&#42; Exclude takes precedence over include. |  | String

[[SpringBoot-Auto-configuredCamelcontext]]
== Auto-configured Camel context

The most important piece of functionality provided by the Camel
auto-configuration is `CamelContext` instance.
Camel auto-configuration creates a `SpringCamelContext` for you and
takes care of the proper initialization and shutdown of that context.
The created Camel context is also registered in the Spring application
context (under `camelContext` bean name), so you can access it just as
 any other Spring bean.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyAppConfig {

  @Autowired
  CamelContext camelContext;

  @Bean
  MyService myService() {
    return new DefaultMyService(camelContext);
  }

}
----

[[SpringBoot-Auto-detectingCamelroutes]]
== Auto-detecting Camel routes

Camel auto-configuration collects all the `RouteBuilder` instances from
the Spring context and automatically injects them into the provided
`CamelContext`. That means that creating new Camel route with the Spring
Boot starter is as simple as adding the `@Component` annotated class to
your classpath:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyRouter extends RouteBuilder {

  @Override
  public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("jms:invoices").to("file:/invoices");
  }

}
----

Or creating a new route `RouteBuilder` bean in your `@Configuration` class:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyRouterConfiguration {

  @Bean
  RoutesBuilder myRouter() {
    return new RouteBuilder() {

      @Override
      public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("jms:invoices").to("file:/invoices");
      }

    };
  }

}
----

[[SpringBoot-Camelproperties]]
== Camel properties

Spring Boot auto-configuration automatically connects
to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config[Spring
Boot external configuration] (like properties placeholders, OS
environment variables or system properties) with
the Camel properties support. It basically means
that any property defined in `application.properties` file:  

[source,text]
----
route.from = jms:invoices
----

Or set via system property:

[source,text]
----
java -Droute.to=jms:processed.invoices -jar mySpringApp.jar
----

...can be used as placeholders in Camel route:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyRouter extends RouteBuilder {

  @Override
  public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("{{route.from}}").to("{{route.to}}");
  }

}
----

[[SpringBoot-CustomCamelcontextconfiguration]]
== Custom Camel context configuration

If you would like to perform some operations on `CamelContext` bean
created by Camel auto-configuration,
register `CamelContextConfiguration` instance in your Spring context:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyAppConfig {

  @Bean
  CamelContextConfiguration contextConfiguration() {
    return new CamelContextConfiguration() {
      @Override
      void beforeApplicationStart(CamelContext context) {
        // your custom configuration goes here
      }
    };
  }

}
----

Method beforeApplicationStart` will
be called just before the Spring context is started, so the
`CamelContext` instance passed to this callback is
fully auto-configured. You can add many instances of
`CamelContextConfiguration` into your Spring context - all of them will
be executed.

[[SpringBoot-DisablingJMX]]
== Disabling JMX

To disable JMX of the auto-configured `CamelContext` use
`camel.springboot.jmxEnabled` property (JMX is enabled by default). For
example you could add the following property to your
`application.properties` file:

[source,text]
----
camel.springboot.jmx-enabled = false
----

[[SpringBoot-Auto-configuredconsumerandproducertemplates]]
== Auto-configured consumer and producer templates

Camel auto-configuration provides pre-configured `ConsumerTemplate` and
`ProducerTemplate` instances. You can simply inject them into your
Spring-managed beans:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class InvoiceProcessor {

  @Autowired
  private ProducerTemplate producerTemplate;

  @Autowired
  private ConsumerTemplate consumerTemplate;

  public void processNextInvoice() {
    Invoice invoice = consumerTemplate.receiveBody("jms:invoices", Invoice.class);
    ...
    producerTemplate.sendBody("netty-http:http://invoicing.com/received/" + invoice.id());
  }

}
----

By default consumer templates and producer templates come with the
endpoint cache sizes set to 1000. You can change those values via the
following Spring properties:

[source,text]
----
camel.springboot.consumer-template-cache-size = 100
camel.springboot.producer-template-cache-size = 200
----

[[SpringBoot-Auto-configuredTypeConverter]]
== Auto-configured TypeConverter

Camel auto-configuration registers a `TypeConverter` instance named
`typeConverter` in the Spring context.

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class InvoiceProcessor {

  @Autowired
  private TypeConverter typeConverter;

  public long parseInvoiceValue(Invoice invoice) {
    String invoiceValue = invoice.grossValue();
    return typeConverter.convertTo(Long.class, invoiceValue);
  }

}
----

[[SpringBoot-SpringtypeconversionAPIbridge]]
=== Spring type conversion API bridge

Spring comes with
the powerful http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html#core-convert[type
conversion API]. Spring API happens to be very similar to the Camel
type converter API. As those APIs are so
similar, Camel Spring Boot automatically registers a bridge converter
(`SpringTypeConverter`) that delegates to the Spring conversion API.That
means that out-of-the-box Camel will treat Spring Converters like Camel
ones. With this approach you can enjoy both Camel and Spring converters
accessed via Camel `TypeConverter` API:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class InvoiceProcessor {

  @Autowired
  private TypeConverter typeConverter;

  public UUID parseInvoiceId(Invoice invoice) {
    // Using Spring's StringToUUIDConverter
    UUID id = invoice.typeConverter.convertTo(UUID.class, invoice.getId());
  }

}
----

Under the hood Camel Spring Boot delegates conversion to the Spring's
`ConversionService` instances available in the application context. If
no `ConversionService` instance is available, Camel Spring Boot
auto-configuration will create one for you.

[[SpringBoot-Disablingtypeconversionsfeatures]]
== Disabling type conversions features

If you don't want Camel Spring Boot to register type-conversions related
features (like `TypeConverter` instance or Spring bridge) set the
`camel.springboot.type-conversion` property to `false`.

[source,text]
----
camel.springboot.type-conversion = false
----


[[SpringBoot-Keepingapplicationalive]]
== Keeping the application alive

Camel applications having this feature enabled launch a new thread on startup for the sole purpose of
keeping the application alive by preventing JVM termination.
It means that after you start a Camel application with Spring Boot, your
application waits for a Ctrl+C signal and does not exit immediately.

The controller thread can be activated using the `camel.springboot.main-run-controller` to `true`.

[source,text]
----
camel.springboot.main-run-controller = true
----

Applications using web modules (e.g. importing the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-web-starter` module),
usually don't need to use this feature because the application is kept alive by the presence of other non-daemon threads.

[[SpringBoot-AddingXMLroutes]]
== Adding XML routes

By default you can put Camel XML routes in the classpath under the
directory camel, which camel-spring-boot will auto detect and include.
You can configure the directory name or turn
this off using the configuration option

[source,text]
----
// turn off
camel.springboot.xml-routes = false
// scan in the com/foo/routes classpath
camel.springboot.xml-routes = classpath:com/foo/routes/*.xml
----

The XML files should be Camel XML routes (not CamelContext) such as

[source,xml]
----
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route id="test">
        <from uri="timer://trigger"/>
        <transform>
            <simple>ref:myBean</simple>
        </transform>
        <to uri="log:out"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

[[SpringBoot-AddingREST]]
== Adding XML Rest-DSL

By default you can put Camel Rest-DSL XML routes in the classpath under the
directory camel-rest, which camel-spring-boot will auto detect and include.
You can configure the directory name or turn this off using the configuration option

[source,text]
----
// turn off
camel.springboot.xml-rests = false
// scan in the com/foo/routes classpath
camel.springboot.xml-rests = classpath:com/foo/rests/*.xml
----

The Rest-DSL XML files should be Camel XML rests (not CamelContext) such as

[source,xml]
----
<rests xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <rest>
     <post uri="/persons">
        <to uri="direct:postPersons"/>
     </post>
     <get uri="/persons">
        <to uri="direct:getPersons"/>
     </get>
     <get uri="/persons/{personId}">
         <to uri="direct:getPersionId"/>
     </get>
     <put uri="/persons/{personId}">
         <to uri="direct:putPersionId"/>
     </put>
     <delete uri="/persons/{personId}">
         <to uri="direct:deletePersionId"/>
     </delete>
  </rest>
</rests>
----

[[SpringBoot-Testing]]
== Testing the JUnit 4 way
For testing, Maven users will need to add the following dependencies to their `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-boot.version}</version> <!-- Use the same version as your Spring Boot version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-test-spring</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

To test a Camel Spring Boot application, annotate your test class(es) with
`@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)`. This brings Camel's Spring Test
support to your application, so that you can write tests using
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html[Spring Boot test conventions].

To get the `CamelContext` or `ProducerTemplate`, you can inject them into the class in the normal Spring manner, using `@Autowired`.

You can also use xref:manual::spring-testing.adoc[Camel Spring test annotations] to configure tests declaratively. This example uses the `@MockEndpoints` annotation to auto-mock an endpoint:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@MockEndpoints("direct:end")
public class MyApplicationTest {

    @Autowired
    private ProducerTemplate template;

    @EndpointInject("mock:direct:end")
    MockEndpoint mock;

    @Test
    public void testReceive() throws Exception {
        mock.expectedBodiesReceived("Hello");
        template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hello");
        mock.assertIsSatisfied();
    }

}
----
== Testing the JUnit 5 way
For testing, Maven users will need to add the following dependencies to their `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-boot.version}</version> <!-- Use the same version as your Spring Boot version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-test-spring-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
