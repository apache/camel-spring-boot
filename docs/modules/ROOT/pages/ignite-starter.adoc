:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for ignite

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using ignite with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-ignite-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 44 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.configuration-resource* | The resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URL, String or InputStream type. The option is a java.lang.Object type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the ignite-cache component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.ignite* | To use an existing Ignite instance. The option is a org.apache.ignite.Ignite type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.ignite-configuration* | Allows the user to set a programmatic ignite configuration. The option is a org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-cache.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.configuration-resource* | The resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URL, String or InputStream type. The option is a java.lang.Object type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the ignite-compute component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.ignite* | To use an existing Ignite instance. The option is a org.apache.ignite.Ignite type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.ignite-configuration* | Allows the user to set a programmatic ignite configuration. The option is a org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration type. |  | String

| *camel.component.ignite-events.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.ignite-events.ignite* | To use an existing Ignite instance. The option is a org.apache.ignite.Ignite type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-events.ignite-configuration* | Allows the user to set a programmatic ignite configuration. The option is a org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration type. |  | String
