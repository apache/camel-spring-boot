|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.bigint-unsigned-handling-mode* | Specify how BIGINT UNSIGNED columns should be represented in change events, including:'precise' uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'long' (the default) represents values using Java's 'long', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers. | long | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.binlog-buffer-size* | The size of a look-ahead buffer used by the binlog reader to decide whether the transaction in progress is going to be committed or rolled back. Use 0 to disable look-ahead buffering. Defaults to 0 (i.e. buffering is disabled). | 0 | Integer

| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.database-server-id-offset* | Only relevant if parallel snapshotting is configured. During parallel snapshotting, multiple (4) connections open to the database client, and they each need their own unique connection ID. This offset is used to generate those IDs from the base configured cluster ID. | 10000 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.database-server-name* | Unique name that identifies the database server and all recorded offsets, and that is used as a prefix for all schemas and topics. Each distinct installation should have a separate namespace and be monitored by at most one Debezium connector. |  | String

| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.decimal-handling-mode* | Specify how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns should be represented in change events, including:'precise' (the default) uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'string' uses string to represent values; 'double' represents values using Java's 'double', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers. | precise | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.enable-time-adjuster* | MySQL allows user to insert year value as either 2-digit or 4-digit. In case of two digit the value is automatically mapped into 1970 - 2069.false - delegates the implicit conversion to the databasetrue - (the default) Debezium makes the conversion | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.event-deserialization-failure-handling-mode* | Specify how failures during deserialization of binlog events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.gtid-new-channel-position* | If set to 'latest', when connector sees new GTID, it will start consuming gtid channel from the server latest executed gtid position. If 'earliest' connector starts reading channel from first available (not purged) gtid position on the server. | latest | String

| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.heartbeat-interval-ms* | Length of an interval in milli-seconds in in which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. Use 0 to disable heartbeat messages. Disabled by default. | 0 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.heartbeat-topics-prefix* | The prefix that is used to name heartbeat topics.Defaults to __debezium-heartbeat. | __debezium-heartbeat | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.include-query* | Whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. Note: This option requires MySQL be configured with the binlog_rows_query_log_events option set to ON. Query will not be present for events generated from snapshot. WARNING: Enabling this option may expose tables or fields explicitly blacklisted or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason the default value is 'false'. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.include-schema-changes* | Whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change will be recorded using a key that contains the database name and whose value includes the DDL statement(s).The default is 'true'. This is independent of how the connector internally records database history. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.inconsistent-schema-handling-mode* | Specify how binlog events that belong to a table missing from internal schema representation (i.e. internal representation is not consistent with database) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.max-batch-size* | Maximum size of each batch of source records. Defaults to 2048. | 2048 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.max-queue-size* | Maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size. | 8192 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.message-key-columns* | A semicolon-separated list of expressions that match fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.poll-interval-ms* | Frequency in milliseconds to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events. Defaults to 500ms. | 500 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-delay-ms* | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-fetch-size* | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot |  | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-locking-mode* | Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is 'minimal', which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this can be done using the snapshot process' REPEATABLE READ transaction even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot; in such cases set this property to 'extended'. Using a value of 'none' will prevent the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. This mode can only be used in combination with snapshot.mode values of 'schema_only' or 'schema_only_recovery' and is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. | minimal | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-mode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'when_needed' to specify that the connector run a snapshot upon startup whenever it deems it necessary; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally read the binlog; and'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the beginning of the binlog. The 'never' mode should be used with care, and only when the binlog is known to contain all history. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-new-tables* | BETA FEATURE: On connector restart, the connector will check if there have been any new tables added to the configuration, and snapshot them. There is presently only two options:'off': Default behavior. Do not snapshot new tables.'parallel': The snapshot of the new tables will occur in parallel to the continued binlog reading of the old tables. When the snapshot completes, an independent binlog reader will begin reading the events for the new tables until it catches up to present time. At this point, both old and new binlog readers will be momentarily halted and new binlog reader will start that will read the binlog for all configured tables. The parallel binlog reader will have a configured server id of 10000 the primary binlog reader's server id. | off | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.table-blacklist* | Description is not available here, please check Debezium website for corresponding key 'table.blacklist' description. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.table-ignore-builtin* | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.table-whitelist* | The tables for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.time-precision-mode* | Time, date and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive_time_microseconds': the precision of date and timestamp values is based the database column's precision; but time fields always use microseconds precision;'connect': always represents time, date and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision. | adaptive_time_microseconds | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.configuration.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the debezium-mysql component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
