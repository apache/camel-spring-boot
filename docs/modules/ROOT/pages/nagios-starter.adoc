== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using nagios with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-nagios-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 10 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.nagios.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.connection-timeout* | Connection timeout in millis. | 5000 | Integer
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.encryption* | To specify an encryption method. |  | Encryption
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.host* | This is the address of the Nagios host where checks should be send. |  | String
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.nagios-settings* |  |  | NagiosSettings
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.password* | Password to be authenticated when sending checks to Nagios. |  | String
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.port* | The port number of the host. |  | Integer
| *camel.component.nagios.configuration.timeout* | Sending timeout in millis. | 5000 | Integer
| *camel.component.nagios.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the nagios component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.nagios.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
