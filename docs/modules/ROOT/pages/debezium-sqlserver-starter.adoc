|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-sqlserver.additional-properties* | Additional properties for debezium components in case they can't be set directly on the camel configurations (e.g: setting Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine, for example setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore), the properties have to be prefixed with additionalProperties..
