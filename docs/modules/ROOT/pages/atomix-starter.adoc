:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for atomix

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using atomix with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-atomix-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 121 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.atomix-map.atomix* | The Atomix instance to use. The option is a io.atomix.Atomix type. |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.atomix-map.configuration* | The shared component configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.atomix.client.map.AtomixMapConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.configuration-uri* | The path to the AtomixClient configuration |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.default-action* | The default action. |  | AtomixMap$Action
| *camel.component.atomix-map.default-resource-config* | The cluster wide default resource configuration. The option is a java.util.Properties type. |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.default-resource-options* | The local default resource options. The option is a java.util.Properties type. |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the atomix-map component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.atomix-map.ephemeral* | Sets if the local member should join groups as PersistentMember or not. If set to ephemeral the local member will receive an auto generated ID thus the local one is ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.atomix-map.key* | The key to use if none is set in the header or to listen for events for a specific key. The option is a java.lang.Object type. |  | String
| *camel.component.atomix-map.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.atomix-messaging.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.
