:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for mina

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using mina with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-mina-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 29 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.mina.allow-default-codec* | The mina component installs a default codec if both, codec is null and textline is false. Setting allowDefaultCodec to false prevents the mina component from installing a default codec as the first element in the filter chain. This is useful in scenarios where another filter must be the first in the filter chain, like the SSL filter. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.auto-start-tls* | Whether to auto start SSL handshake. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.cached-address* | Whether to create the InetAddress once and reuse. Setting this to false allows to pickup DNS changes in the network. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.client-mode* | If the clientMode is true, mina consumer will connect the address as a TCP client. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.codec* | To use a custom minda codec implementation. The option is a org.apache.mina.filter.codec.ProtocolCodecFactory type. |  | String
| *camel.component.mina.configuration* | To use the shared mina configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.mina.MinaConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.mina.decoder-max-line-length* | To set the textline protocol decoder max line length. By default the default value of Mina itself is used which are 1024. | 1024 | Integer
| *camel.component.mina.disconnect* | Whether or not to disconnect(close) from Mina session right after use. Can be used for both consumer and producer. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.disconnect-on-no-reply* | If sync is enabled then this option dictates MinaConsumer if it should disconnect where there is no reply to send back. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the mina component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.encoder-max-line-length* | To set the textline protocol encoder max line length. By default the default value of Mina itself is used which are Integer.MAX_VALUE. | -1 | Integer
| *camel.component.mina.encoding* | You can configure the encoding (a charset name) to use for the TCP textline codec and the UDP protocol. If not provided, Camel will use the JVM default Charset |  | String
| *camel.component.mina.filters* | You can set a list of Mina IoFilters to use. |  | List
| *camel.component.mina.lazy-session-creation* | Sessions can be lazily created to avoid exceptions, if the remote server is not up and running when the Camel producer is started. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.maximum-pool-size* | Number of worker threads in the worker pool for TCP and UDP | 16 | Integer
| *camel.component.mina.mina-logger* | You can enable the Apache MINA logging filter. Apache MINA uses slf4j logging at INFO level to log all input and output. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.no-reply-log-level* | If sync is enabled this option dictates MinaConsumer which logging level to use when logging a there is no reply to send back. |  | LoggingLevel
| *camel.component.mina.ordered-thread-pool-executor* | Whether to use ordered thread pool, to ensure events are processed orderly on the same channel. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.ssl-context-parameters* | To configure SSL security. The option is a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters type. |  | String
| *camel.component.mina.sync* | Setting to set endpoint as one-way or request-response. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.textline* | Only used for TCP. If no codec is specified, you can use this flag to indicate a text line based codec; if not specified or the value is false, then Object Serialization is assumed over TCP. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.textline-delimiter* | Only used for TCP and if textline=true. Sets the text line delimiter to use. If none provided, Camel will use DEFAULT. This delimiter is used to mark the end of text. |  | MinaTextLineDelimiter
| *camel.component.mina.timeout* | You can configure the timeout that specifies how long to wait for a response from a remote server. The timeout unit is in milliseconds, so 60000 is 60 seconds. | 30000 | Long
| *camel.component.mina.transfer-exchange* | Only used for TCP. You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body. The following fields are transferred: In body, Out body, fault body, In headers, Out headers, fault headers, exchange properties, exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.mina.write-timeout* | Maximum amount of time it should take to send data to the MINA session. Default is 10000 milliseconds. | 10000 | Long
| *camel.component.mina.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
