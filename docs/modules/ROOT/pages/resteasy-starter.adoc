:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for resteasy

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using resteasy with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-resteasy-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 18 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.resteasy.allow-java-serialized-object* | Whether to allow java serialization when a request uses context-type=application/x-java-serialized-object. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the resteasy component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.header-filter-strategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. The option is a org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy type. |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.http-binding* | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. The option is a org.apache.camel.http.common.HttpBinding type. |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-domain* | Proxy authentication domain to use |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-host* | Proxy authentication host |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-method* | Proxy authentication method to use |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-nt-host* | Proxy authentication domain (workstation name) to use with NTML |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-password* | Proxy authentication password |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-port* | Proxy authentication port |  | Integer
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-auth-username* | Proxy authentication username |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.proxy-consumers-classes* | Proxy classes for consumer endpoints. Multiple classes can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.ssl-context-parameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters. Important: Only one instance of org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters is supported per HttpComponent. If you need to use 2 or more different instances, you need to define a new HttpComponent per instance you need. The option is a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters type. |  | String
| *camel.component.resteasy.use-global-ssl-context-parameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.resteasy.x509-hostname-verifier* | To use a custom X509HostnameVerifier such as DefaultHostnameVerifier or NoopHostnameVerifier. The option is a javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier type. |  | String
