</dependency>

The component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.google-drive.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-drive.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-drive.client-factory* | To use the GoogleCalendarClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleDriveClientFactory. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.google.drive.GoogleDriveClientFactory type. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.access-token* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.api-name* | What kind of operation to perform |  | GoogleDriveApiName
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.application-name* | Google drive application name. Example would be camel-google-drive/1.0 |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.client-id* | Client ID of the drive application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.client-secret* | Client secret of the drive application |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.method-name* | What sub operation to use for the selected operation |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.refresh-token* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *camel.component.google-drive.configuration.scopes* | Specifies the level of permissions you want a drive application to have to a user account. See \https://developers.google.com/drive/web/scopes for more info. |  | List
| *camel.component.google-drive.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the google-drive component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.google-drive.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
