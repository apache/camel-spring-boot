When using milo with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-milo-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.milo-client.allowed-security-policies* | A set of allowed security policy URIs. Default is to accept all and use the highest. |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.application-name* | The application name | Apache Camel adapter for Eclipse Milo | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.application-uri* | The application URI | http://camel.apache.org/EclipseMilo/Client | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.milo-client.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.milo-client.channel-lifetime* | Channel lifetime in milliseconds |  | Long
| *camel.component.milo-client.client-id* | A virtual client id to force the creation of a new connection instance |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.configuration* | All default options for client configurations. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.milo.client.MiloClientConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.discovery-endpoint-suffix* | A suffix for endpoint URI when discovering |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.discovery-endpoint-uri* | An alternative discovery URI |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the milo-client component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.milo-client.key-alias* | The name of the key in the keystore file |  | String
| *camel.component.milo-client.key-password* | The key password |  | String

| *camel.component.milo-client.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.milo-client.max-pending-publish-requests* | The maximum number of pending publish requests |  | Long
