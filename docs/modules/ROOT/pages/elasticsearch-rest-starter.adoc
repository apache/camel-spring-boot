== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using elasticsearch-rest with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-elasticsearch-rest-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 14 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.client* | To use an existing configured Elasticsearch client, instead of creating a client per endpoint. This allow to customize the client with specific settings. The option is a org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient type. |  | String
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.connection-timeout* | The time in ms to wait before connection will timeout. | 30000 | Integer
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.enable-s-s-l* | Enable SSL | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.enable-sniffer* | Enable automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the elasticsearch-rest component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.host-addresses* | Comma separated list with ip:port formatted remote transport addresses to use. The ip and port options must be left blank for hostAddresses to be considered instead. |  | String
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.max-retry-timeout* | The time in ms before retry | 30000 | Integer
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.password* | Password for authenticate |  | String
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.sniff-after-failure-delay* | The delay of a sniff execution scheduled after a failure (in milliseconds) | 60000 | Integer
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.sniffer-interval* | The interval between consecutive ordinary sniff executions in milliseconds. Will be honoured when sniffOnFailure is disabled or when there are no failures between consecutive sniff executions | 300000 | Integer
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.socket-timeout* | The timeout in ms to wait before the socket will timeout. | 30000 | Integer
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.user* | Basic authenticate user |  | String
| *camel.component.elasticsearch-rest.basic-property-binding* | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
