When using crypto-cms with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-crypto-cms-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.crypto-cms.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.crypto-cms.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the crypto-cms component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.crypto-cms.enveloped-data-decryptor-configuration* | To configure the shared EnvelopedDataDecryptorConfiguration, which determines the uri parameters for the decrypt operation. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.crypto.cms.crypt.EnvelopedDataDecryptorConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.crypto-cms.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.crypto-cms.signed-data-verifier-configuration* | To configure the shared SignedDataVerifierConfiguration, which determines the uri parameters for the verify operation. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.crypto.cms.sig.SignedDataVerifierConfiguration type. |  | String
|===
