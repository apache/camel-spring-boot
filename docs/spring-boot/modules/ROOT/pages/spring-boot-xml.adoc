[[SpringBootXml-SpringBootXml]]
= Spring Boot XML

*Since Camel 3.9*

Support for using Spring XML files containing Camel XML routes.

However this is not a recommended practice as Camel XML is creating and managing a `SpringCamelContext`
created by standard Spring framework that predates Spring Boot.
