:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for debezium-mysql

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using debezium-mysql with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-debezium-mysql-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 89 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.additional-properties* | Additional properties for debezium components in case they can't be set directly on the camel configurations (e.g: setting Kafka Connect properties needed by Debezium engine, for example setting KafkaOffsetBackingStore), the properties have to be prefixed with additionalProperties.. E.g: additionalProperties.transactional.id=12345&additionalProperties.schema.registry.url=\http://localhost:8811/avro |  | Map
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.autowired-enabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.bigint-unsigned-handling-mode* | Specify how BIGINT UNSIGNED columns should be represented in change events, including:'precise' uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'long' (the default) represents values using Java's 'long', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers. | long | String

Note: This option requires MySQL be configured with the binlog_rows_query_log_events option set to ON. Query will not be present for events generated from snapshot. WARNING: Enabling this option may expose tables or fields explicitly blacklisted or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason the default value is 'false'. | false | Boolean

| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.snapshot-locking-mode* | Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is 'minimal', which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this can be done using the snapshot process' REPEATABLE READ transaction even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot; in such cases set this property to 'extended'. Using a value of 'none' will prevent the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. This mode can only be used in combination with snapshot.mode values of 'schema_only' or 'schema_only_recovery' and is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. | minimal | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.snapshot-max-threads* | The maximum number of threads used to perform the snapshot. Defaults to 1. | 1 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.snapshot-mode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'when_needed' to specify that the connector run a snapshot upon startup whenever it deems it necessary; 'schema_only' to only take a snapshot of the schema (table structures) but no actual data; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally read the binlog; and'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the beginning of the binlog. The 'never' mode should be used with care, and only when the binlog is known to contain all history. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.snapshot-new-tables* | BETA FEATURE: On connector restart, the connector will check if there have been any new tables added to the configuration, and snapshot them. There is presently only two options:'off': Default behavior. Do not snapshot new tables.'parallel': The snapshot of the new tables will occur in parallel to the continued binlog reading of the old tables. When the snapshot completes, an independent binlog reader will begin reading the events for the new tables until it catches up to present time. At this point, both old and new binlog readers will be momentarily halted and new binlog reader will start that will read the binlog for all configured tables. The parallel binlog reader will have a configured server id of 10000 the primary binlog reader's server id. | off | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String

| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.table-exclude-list* | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.table-ignore-builtin* | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.table-include-list* | The tables for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.table-whitelist* | The tables for which changes are to be captured (deprecated, use table.include.list instead) |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.time-precision-mode* | Time, date and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive_time_microseconds': the precision of date and timestamp values is based the database column's precision; but time fields always use microseconds precision;'connect': always represents time, date and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision. | adaptive_time_microseconds | String
| *camel.component.debezium-mysql.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
