:doctitle: Camel Spring Boot Starter for debezium-postgres

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using debezium-postgres with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-debezium-postgres-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component.

'columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can improve connector performance significantly if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data that are rarely part of these updates.

| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshot-mode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'always' to specify that the connector run a snapshot each time it starts up; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally start emitting changes;'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the last position (LSN) recorded by the server; and'exported' to specify the connector should run a snapshot based on the position when the replication slot was created; 'custom' to specify a custom class with 'snapshot.custom_class' which will be loaded and used to determine the snapshot, see docs for more details. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String

| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.time-precision-mode* | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.toasted-value-placeholder* | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database. If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | __debezium_unavailable_value | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.xmin-fetch-interval-ms* | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. The option is a long type. | 0 | Long
